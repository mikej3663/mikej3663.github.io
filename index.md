## About Me

Welcome to my website! I'm originally from Westchester, New York, and I'm currently a senior at Lehigh University where I study Financial Engineering in the Integrated Business and Engineering (IBE) honors program. Following my graduation from Lehigh, I will be working for Greenhill & Co. in New York City as an investment banking analyst. 

Some things I enjoy doing in my free time:
 - Reading about new IPO's, stock predictions, company financial analysis
 - Looking into space advancements with NASA, SpaceX, Blue Origin, and all the other amazing new initiatives
 - Watching sports, specifically the Giants (NFL), Rangers (NHL), Knicks (NBA), and Mets (MLB)
 - Strong passion towards fitness
 - Playing strategic games with friends
