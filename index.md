## About Me

Welcome to my website! I'm originally from Westchester, New York, and I'm currently a senior at Lehigh University where I study Financial Engineering in the Integrated Business and Engineering (IBE) honors program.

Some things I enjoy doing in my free time:
 - Reading about new IPO's, stock predictions, company financial analysis
 - Looking into space advancements with NASA, SpaceX, Blue Origin, and all the other amazing new initiatives
 - Watching sports, specifically the Giants (NFL), Rangers (NHL), Knicks (NBA), and Mets (MLB)
 - Strong passion towards fitness

_**[Quantifying 10-K Sentiment and Stock Price Impact](midterm_summary)**_

In this project, I modeled how sentiment in 2022 S&P 500 10-K filings affected stock returns one to four trading days after release, focusing on divestitures, lawsuits, and new product launches. I found that aggregate positive and negative sentiment scores had virtually no predictive power, whereas contextual sentiment around divestitures and lawsuits produced modest but meaningful slopes and mentions of new products consistently forecasted a negative price reaction. My regression’s R² was respectable, indicating the model captured enough variation to validate these event-specific signals despite low overall explanatory power. Overall, these results suggest that granular, event-driven sentiment measures offer more insight into market responses than aggregate sentiment alone.
