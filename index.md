## About Me

Welcome to my website! I'm originally from Westchester, New York, and I'm currently a senior at Lehigh University where I study Financial Engineering in the Integrated Business and Engineering (IBE) honors program. Following my graduation from Lehigh, I will be working for Greenhill & Co. in New York City as an investment banking analyst. 

Some things I enjoy doing in my free time:
 - Reading about new IPO's, stock predictions, company financial analysis
 - Looking into space advancements with NASA, SpaceX, Blue Origin, and all the other amazing new initiatives
 - Watching sports, specifically the Giants (NFL), Rangers (NHL), Knicks (NBA), and Mets (MLB)
 - Strong passion towards fitness
 - Playing strategic games with friends

## Portfolio

_**[Quantifying 10-K Sentiment and Stock Price Impact](midterm_summary)**_

In this project, I modeled how sentiment in 2022 S&P 500 10-K filings affected stock returns one to four trading days after release, focusing on divestitures, lawsuits, and new product launches. I found that aggregate positive and negative sentiment scores had virtually no predictive power, whereas contextual sentiment around divestitures and lawsuits produced modest but meaningful slopes and mentions of new products consistently forecasted a negative price reaction. My regression’s R² was respectable, indicating the model captured enough variation to validate these event-specific signals despite low overall explanatory power. Overall, these results suggest that granular, event-driven sentiment measures offer more insight into market responses than aggregate sentiment alone.

  <b>Lehigh Asset Pricing Dashboard</b>
</a>

Myself alongside my team developed a Lehigh Asset Pricing model where we fit regressors and neural networks to predict stock returns and construct a zero-cost long-short portfolio. We ingested WRDS CRSP, OpenAP, and Fama–French factor data, selected the top 5,000 firms by net operating assets, and trained Lasso, Ridge, HistGradientBoosting, and three MLP architectures using an expanding window approach. Predictions were binned into portfolios to compute Sharpe ratios where HistGradientBoosting achieved the best, and the 3 fold Nueral Network achieved the best of the networks, while the overal best was the stacked regessor we developed.
